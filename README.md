# Ygg

A small home directory for the **Yggdrasil command family**.

## What this is

`~/ygg` is the human-facing control surface for the command system we have been designing around:

- **spine** — planner/control plane
- **branches** — bounded task lanes
- **promotion** — explicit return of meaningful branch outcomes
- **durable trace** — files/logs/batons that carry continuity across time

This directory exists to make the system easier to understand, inspect, and evolve.

## Important current reality

Ygg is now split into three package surfaces:

- `code/` — CLI code, tests, docs
- `machine/` — host bootstrap/setup scripts
- `state/` — state templates/policy + runtime output area

The planner/resume internals still depend on assistant-home modules in:

- `~/.openclaw/workspace-claw-main/scripts/work.py`
- `~/.openclaw/workspace-claw-main/tools/work_v1/`
- `~/.openclaw/workspace-claw-main/scripts/resume.py`
- `~/.openclaw/workspace-claw-main/state/resume/`

So this is a **packaged control plane** with a live dependency on the canonical spine workspace.

## Layout

- `code/` — portable CLI package (`code/src`, `code/bin`, `code/tests`, `code/docs`)
- `machine/` — portable host bootstrap package (`machine/bootstrap-host.sh`)
- `state/` — templates/policy + runtime state boundary (`state/templates`, `state/policy`, `state/runtime`)
- `bin/` — compatibility launcher shim (`bin/ygg` -> `code/bin/ygg`)
- `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` — compatibility symlinks to `code/*`
- `links/` — local symlinks to assistant-home implementation pointers

## Naming

- **Architecture name:** Yggdrasil
- **CLI namespace:** `ygg`
- **Style rule:** poetic topology, clear action semantics

## First files to read

## Current CLI status

A usable prototype entrypoint exists at:

- `~/ygg/bin/ygg`
- exposed on PATH as `ygg` via `~/.local/bin/ygg`

Current verbs:

- `ygg explain`
- `ygg help` (alias of `explain`)
- `ygg suggest`
- `ygg work`
- `ygg paths` (path-contract show/check)
- `ygg root`
- `ygg branch`
- `ygg resume`
- `ygg forge`
- `ygg promote`
- `ygg status`

## Quick start

```bash
ygg --help
ygg explain suggest
ygg help promote
ygg paths check
ygg suggest "implement the improved theme selector UX"
ygg status
ygg root "help me decide the next move"
```

## Why this directory exists

The point is not just convenience.
A clear filesystem shape helps the human operator:

- understand what the system is
- inspect current code paths
- see what is stable vs planned
- follow architectural evolution without spelunking the entire assistant workspace
